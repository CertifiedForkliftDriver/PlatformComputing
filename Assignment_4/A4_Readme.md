# Generate Users

This assignment had us work individually to simulate a user using selenium and its capabilities to simulate what a 
standard user would act like or would search for when accessing a website. In this example i used different 
methods in order to implement the requirements and had to use a try and except block in order for the
selenium script to complete even if the element was not found.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total
