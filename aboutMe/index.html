        <h2>EDM Music</h2>
        <p>I remember playing games on my computer
            and pulling up some music playlist to "lock in".
            These playlist were mostly EDM music like dubstep or,
            house music, so naturally i gained an appreciation towards
            this genre of music. I love hearing the music at a live event,
            with all the lights and all the people, its magical and something
            i recommend for people who want to try it out. My brother was a big influence for my
            music taste, he also really liked dubstep and we always listen to Daft Punk, a french EDM duo.

        <h2>Nature</h2>
        <p>Ever since i was young i have always 
            loved being outside with nature and
            appreciating the beauty of our planet. 
            To appreciate the little things like the 
            breeze on your face and the way the 
            leaves rustle with the wind. Going into lakes, swimming,
            fishing, ive never gone hunting but i would really like to go
            in order to get closer to nature, we are so dissasociated with how
            our food gets to our table we often forget that an living thing
            died in order to give us food.

        <h2>Gym</h2>
        <p>I love going to the gym it is therapuetic for me.
            Once i get in there i feel like nothing else matters but me lifting
            that weight. I always push myself to do better the next day,
            and i feel this way of thinking leaks into my everyday life
            so i push myself harder on something i might not be able to do 
            and suprise myself when i CAN do it. I like feeling healthy and fit, 
            I also want to be fit and healthy for my kids and my grandkids so going 
            to the gym regularly for the rest of my life is one of my goals. There are other things
            that correlate with the gym like the sauna, steam room, and cold plunges, which are all
            really good for not only your physical health but your mental health as well.
